## Preview

This is our take on a Workout tracking and sharing app.

## Technology Used

- Vanilla javascript, css and html.
- Sequelize, pg, express, ejs, method-override, dotenv
- embedded Youtube videos
- I linked a font from fonts.googleapis.
- Heroku hosted server and database

## Theory

We wanted to create an app where any user can sign up, login, and track their fitness journey. We utilized two separate tables named Workouts and Users that have a many to many relationship. They work through a JOIN table called UserWorkouts that will display on the user's profile page all the workouts they have added to the JOIN table. 
   
## How The Join Table Works


   
## Main Features

## User Stories

1. I want to see the homepage when I go to the URL
2. I should be able to login to my profile page as an existing user or signup as a new user
3. I want to see a list of all possible workouts to add to the “My Workouts” section of my profile
4. I want to have a link to any workouts added to My Workouts to see more info about that workout and/or edit the workout
5. There should be a link to an index page of all workouts with a link to create a new workout
